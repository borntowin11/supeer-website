        <h3>Essential O'Level Requirements</h3>
        <p>Most universities require credit passes in at least five (5) subjects, including English Language and Mathematics, obtained in not more than two sittings. However, highly competitive courses like Medicine often demand these credits in a single sitting, acting as a competitive filter.</p>
        <p>Check the specific O'level requirements for your chosen course directly on the university's admission portal.</p>

        <h3>Navigating University Cut-Off Marks</h3>
        <p>While JAMB sets a general minimum cut-off, individual universities and courses set their own, often much higher, cut-off marks. These vary significantly based on competitiveness and demand, revealing a "competitive spectrum" among institutions. Aiming significantly higher than the minimum is advisable for competitive programs.</p>
        <p>For the most current cut-off marks, always refer to the official university admission portals.</p>
